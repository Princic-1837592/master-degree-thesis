\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
In this chapter, we present the findings from the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance
and usability of the mixed reality musical keyboard application, Keyrtual.
The results are structured into two primary sections: quantitative results, which measure the technical performance
of the keyboard detection and real-time interaction processes, and qualitative results,
which assess user feedback based on perceived ease of use and experience.
Through these experiments, we aim to establish the effectiveness of the application
and highlight areas for further development.
