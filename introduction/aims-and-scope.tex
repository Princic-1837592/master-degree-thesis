\section{Aims and scope}\label{sec:aims-and-scope}
Hand gesture recognition is becoming an increasingly important field, thanks in part to the advent
and spread of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices.
In these scenarios, the ability to use only their hands
allows the user to feel completely immersed in the experience,
without necessarily having to use or wear additional devices such as controllers or tracking gloves.
Nevertheless, augmented reality and virtual reality devices often make use of special hardware
dedicated specifically to hand detection and gesture recognition.

The purpose of this work is to create a mixed reality application for smartphones that relies only on the
hardware available on the smartphone itself, and allows the user to use their hands to play on a semi-virtual piano,
drawn on paper, reproducing the sound of the notes played.

The main target group of the application is primary and secondary school students.
For them, the application would serve as a first approach to learning the piano,
allowing them to experience first-hand how it works and what it means to play, but without the initial
investment needed to buy the physical instrument, nor all that relates to its transport, storage and maintenance.
